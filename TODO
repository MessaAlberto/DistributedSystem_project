On Node
- add random time delay
- set the coordinator with the request
- coordinator managed the request with other nodes
- add ring logic for saving info

- versioning (lab 3) --> sequential order
- add join/leave/crash/recovery logic (view changes) (lab 3)
- set 2 message dispatchers (one for active node, one for inactive node)

On Client
- send request to specific node
- handle multiple requests

On Main
- keep track of current scenario: active/inactive nodes, active client and manage the client request list on creation
- create random client
- create specific client to test different scenarios
